# Node.js Server Unresponsiveness

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Node.js servers: unresponsiveness due to long-running asynchronous operations.  The `server.js` file contains code that simulates a 5-second delay.  During this delay, the server won't respond to new requests. The `server-solution.js` demonstrates a more robust solution using techniques like asynchronous task management.

## How to Reproduce the Bug

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `node server.js`.
3. Try to access the server (e.g., using `curl http://localhost:3000` or a browser) during the 5-second delay. You may observe the server is unresponsive.

## Solution

The `server-solution.js` file presents a potential solution, using proper error management and asynchronous task handling (Illustrative examples might include promises, async/await, or task queues).
